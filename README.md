AutoHotKey script to temporarily mute PC master volume

I created this script to easily skip ads while listening to the radio.

To get it working just install [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) then execute the mute.akh script (double click on it).

Next time your hear ads just press the **pause button** on your keyboard, the sound will fade out to a low level for 220 seconds, and then fade back in to the original volume.

You can easily tweak the script to suit your own needs, if you want to use a different button or mute for a longer/shorter time.
